# InnerVerse — Known follow-ups

Ledger of audit findings, deferred decisions, and accepted tech debt.
Append-only — never delete past entries. Status transitions (OPEN →
IN PROGRESS → FIXED → WON'T FIX) are recorded in-place by editing the
`Status:` line, not by removing the entry.

## How this file is used

- **Fresh-session audits** (see `review-cadence/audit-prompt-template.md`)
  append a dated section with numbered findings from the four review
  agents.
- **Operator-initiated items** (decisions to defer, limitations we
  know about, items surfaced outside a formal audit) can be added as
  their own dated section.
- **Resolved items** stay in the ledger with `Status: FIXED (<date>,
  <commit-SHA>)` so the trail is auditable. Don't purge.

## Finding format

```
FINDING <N>
Severity: CRITICAL | HIGH | MED | LOW
Lens: security | data-integrity | correctness | architecture | operator
Location: <file>:<line-or-range>
Root cause: <one sentence>
Blast radius: <who, when, worst case>
Suggested fix: <concrete action>
Status: OPEN | IN PROGRESS | FIXED (<date>, <commit>) | WON'T FIX (<reason>)
```

## Open items known at setup time

None yet. First audit will populate this section.
